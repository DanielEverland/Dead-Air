----------Psychological Management----------
The goal is to stay alive for a week
Emphasis on the state of mind of your colonists

----------Game Loop----------
Micro-manage a handful of colony members
You only control one colonist at the time, but can switch freely like in Sims
You're not in direct control of what your colonists do. They do what they wish, you can only suggest actions
You can queue instructions so colonists that are not controlled do not become useless

----------Failure Events----------
Suicide
Abandoning Colony
Anger -> Homicide
Depression
Stress
Anxiety
Infection

----------Infected----------
Infections are airborne
Infected are not dead - they're mutated
Dead infected will release spores a couple of days after dying
Infected are sensitive to light

----------Infection Symptoms----------
Sore throat
Headache
Fever
Broken blood vessels in eyes

----------Visuals----------
Add visual juxtaposition. Make infected areas beautiful, vibrant and colorful.
The more infected and dangerous an area is, the prettier it should become.

Since infected are sensitive to light, infected areas will primarily be found
within darkness. However, areas of extreme outbreak should be lighted by blue
bioluminescent light

----------Brainstorm List----------
Noise system
Books to learn

----------TODO----------
Research difference between sunlight, electrical light and bioluminescent light
